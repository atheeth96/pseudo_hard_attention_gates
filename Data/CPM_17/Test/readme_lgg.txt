This is the test dataset (LGG) for the digital pathology segmentation challenge. In this 
dataset there are 8 images. 

The 8 images are extracted as rectangular tiles from whole slide tissue images at the 
highest resolution. The image capture magnifications (objective powers) at which the 
source whole slide images were obtained are as follows: 

Image Name		Magnification
